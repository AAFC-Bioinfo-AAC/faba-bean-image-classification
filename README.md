# WGRF Faba beans Image Classification Pipeline

- Repository to store code and files related to image work
The current work involves constructing of image classification pipeline to use faba bean images as the input file, to extract the features from them and make accurate class predictions based on deep learning models. This work involves the use of different machine learning and deep learning models such as SegmentAnything (SAM), OpenCV, Sci-kit, supervision and CNN classification.
